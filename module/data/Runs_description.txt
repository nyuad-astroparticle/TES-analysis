Run 1: 

    The first run was a background test intended to measure the photon-like DCR. Additionally, in the same run, we measured the high-energy DCR, which we 
    hypothesized to be caused by cosmic rays or natural radioactive decays interacting with the TES substrate.

    Run1.1 and Run1.2 are part of Run1 conducted on two different days. 

Run 2:

    In Run 2, we utilized a radioactive source, 232Th, to test the response of the TES (Transition Edge Sensor) to high-energy gamma events. 
    This source was placed against the exterior of the ADR (Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator) and aligned perpendicularly to the TES substrate. 
    The 232Th source used in this run had an activity measured at approximately 10 kBq.

Run 3:

    In Run 3, a different radioactive source, 22Na, was employed. 
    This source, with an activity of around 32kBq, was also placed against the exterior of the ADR and aligned perpendicularly to the TES substrate. 
    The emission spectrum of 22Na is notable for its two prominent photoelectric peaks. 
    One of these peaks is significant for the simultaneous emission of two back-to-back 511keV photons, resulting from electron-positron annihilation following a β+ decay. 
    In this setup, the source was sandwiched between the ADR and a plastic scintillator connected to a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT), referred to as a “saber.” 
    This arrangement allowed for the measurement of double coincidences of the back-to-back gamma rays, capturing these events with both the saber and the TES.


Run 4:

    Run 4 was designed as part of a series of tests to demonstrate that cosmic rays can induce high-energy events in the TES (Transition Edge Sensor). 
    This test involved the implementation of a cosmic ray coincidence system. The setup included three sabers, which are specialized sensors, placed side-by-side directly below 
    the ADR (Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator). These sabers were operated at a consistent gain with a 10% uncertainty margin and had their thresholds set at 120 mV, equivalent to 250 keV. 
    The specific calibration details of these sabers can be found in the appendix. The overarching goal of Run 4 was to explore and quantify the interactions between cosmic rays and the TES, 
    using two distinct data acquisition modes, Run 4A and Run 4B.

    Run 4A:

        In Run 4A, lasting about 19 hours, the focus was on recording instances of simultaneous triggering between the TES and all three sabers, indicative of cosmic ray showers 
        or muon bundle events. The data acquisition system was set up such that the oscilloscope triggered on the combined (AND) signal of the three sabers, while also capturing the TES signal. 
        This configuration was primarily aimed at determining the ratio of quadruple coincidences (events registered by both the TES and all three sabers) to triple coincidences 
        (events detected only by the sabers).

    Run 4B:
        Run 4B, with a duration of approximately 14 hours, differed in its triggering mechanism. Here, the trigger was set on the TES for signals exceeding 0.8 eV. 
        During this run, the system also recorded the outputs from all three sabers. The primary purpose of Run 4B was to estimate the ratio of quadruple coincidences 
        (events detected by the TES and the three sabers) to the total number of high-energy events observed by the TES. This mode was essential for understanding the proportion 
        of cosmic ray-induced events relative to the total high-energy events detected by the TES.
